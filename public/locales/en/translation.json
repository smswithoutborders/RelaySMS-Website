		"Header": "Frequently Asked Questions",

		"Q1": "When do I use RelaySMS?",
		"A1": "During times of instability (e.g elections, protests, etc) and other periods are prone to internet shutdowns",
		"A12": "When moving to areas with limited connectivity. The user may find themselves without an internet connection and similar alternatives and the need to send urgent messages online.",

		"Q2": "How does RelaySMS work??",
		"A2": "RelaySMS works by using SMS messages sent from your app to SMS Gateway clients run by  volunteers across the globe who can receive these SMS messages and forward them to the internet.",

		"Q3": "Do I need an internet connection to use RelaySMS?",
		"A3": "Once you have the app setup and configured you no longer require access to an internet connection; Messages are being transmitted by SMS from your device.",

		"Q4": "Is RelaySMS available on my device?",
		"A4": "RelaySMS is currently available on Android and iOS; Linux is coming soon…How much does RelaySMS cost?",
		"A41": "RelaySMS is free bu are no limits on the size and number of messages you can send with the app.t The standard SMS rates (as determined by the user’s service provider) do apply.",
		"A42": "SMS is billed per segment of the message - a single segment of SMS is about 140 standard ascii characters. This means an SMS user can send a single message that contains multiple segments and would be billed per segment of the message sent. The SMS messages from RelaySMS get sent out as a single message, but the billing would depend on how many segments are in the message.",
		"A43": "The amount of segments for RelaySMS users is determined by the size of the message being sent; the more segments (the longer the message) the more it will cost to send the message..",
		"A44": "Are there any limitations on offline messages?",
		"A45": "SMS is not as reliable as the internet, so reliability is a limitation. Usually some SMS messages do not make it to the Gateway Clients and as such do not get published online.",

		"Q5": "I'm experiencing technical difficulties with the app. How can I get help?",
		"A5": " RelaySMS utilizes secure practices in requesting and storing access from users for their later use. The requests are done through secured protocols such as OAuth2.0. The access and user details associated with are encrypted and stored in the Vault - while the scope of the OAuth2.0 access allows users to see whatever action is done from within the accounts of the online platform.",
		"A51": "The messages sent from the RelaySMS app to the Vault are encrypted with perfect forward secrecy (this utilizes the Signal Double Ratchet protocol) and can only be decrypted at the level of the Vault. This provides security during transportation of the message.",
